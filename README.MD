## Disclaimer

The Inf parser code was written by hand. Based on it, Dsc, Dec, and Uni parsers were added using vibecoding. LLM significantly reworked the tests in some places, but overall they allow the parsers to be kept in a consistent state. Due to lack of time, meaningful code support is not planned. All subsequent fixes will also be generated by LLM. The goal of the project is simply to provide at least some reasonable navigation through EDK2 in CLion.

## Checking the parser's operation

`./gradlew validateParsers -Pedk2Path=$(realpath ~/git/edk2)`
